As part of the Codaisseur bootcamp, we had to develop a project in a group using React in about four days, the theme was "Entertainment". 
We did this Hangman - Movie Edition game, fetching data from TMDB Api.
It was a fantastic opportunity to work in a team and practice our communication skills while implementing solutions. Additionally, using Git allowed us to improve our collaboration and problem-solving skills.The random faces on the hangman are our lovely teachers :)
